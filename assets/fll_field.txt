To use custom map backgrounds:

1. Add image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP) to this "assets" folder

2. The app will automatically load the first image found in this folder when it starts

3. You can also select a different map image using the "Select Map Image" button in the Map tab

4. Examples of useful images include:
   - FLL competition field layouts
   - Custom maps of your testing area
   - Diagrams of robot paths

Note: The coordinate system in the app (0-100 cm) will be overlaid on any image you add.
