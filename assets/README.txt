# Assets Folder

This folder contains image files for use as map backgrounds in the CodLess app.

## Map Requirements

- Images should ideally be square or have a similar aspect ratio to the app's map view
- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP formats are supported
- High contrast images work best for placing waypoints

## Using Maps

1. Place your map images in this folder
2. In the app, go to the Map tab and click "Select Map Image"
3. Choose your image from this folder
4. The image will be displayed as a background for your waypoints
5. When you save a route with a map, the association will be saved

## Notes

- Images from other locations will be automatically copied to this folder
- The coordinate system (0-100 for both X and Y) will be overlaid on the image
- You can clear the map background at any time by clicking "Clear Map Image"
