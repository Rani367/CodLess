**Visual programming for FLL teams**

CodLess is a web-based tool that helps FIRST LEGO League teams program their robots without writing complex code. You can connect your LEGO hub, record movements, save them as reusable runs, and use them during competitions.

**üîê New: Secure Cloud Storage** - Sign in with email or Google to save your robot runs to the cloud, access them from any device, and collaborate with your team!

- Upload and run Python code directly on the hub
- Real-time 2D simulation of robot movements
- Motor calibration for accurate control
- Export and import saved runs
- Works offline after the first load
- Runs in the browser, no installation needed
- **üîê Secure Authentication**: Sign in with email/password or Google account

## Setting Up Authentication (Optional)

CodLess works perfectly without authentication - all features are available locally. However, if you want to enable cloud storage and sync across devices:

1. Follow the [Firebase Setup Guide](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) to configure your own Firebase project
2. Update `firebase-config.js` with your Firebase credentials
3. Deploy the app to your preferred hosting service

The authentication system provides:
- Secure login with email/password or Google account
- Cloud storage for all your saved runs
- Automatic sync across devices
- Team collaboration features
- Complete data privacy and security
