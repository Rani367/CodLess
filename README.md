# CodLess™

### A new way to program robotics

CodLess™ is not just another tool. It is a rethinking of how FIRST LEGO League teams approach robot programming.  

After months of iteration, refinement, and countless hours spent perfecting both the interface and the underlying architecture, CodLess™ has finally reached the point where it feels complete.  

## Why CodLess™

CodLess™ is designed for teams that want power and simplicity at the same time.  

• A clean interface that makes complex robotics control feel natural  
• Real-time Bluetooth connection to Pybricks-compatible LEGO hubs  
• Movement recording that can be saved and replayed as digital runs  

## Getting Started

1. Open [CodLess™](https://rani367.github.io/CodLess/) in Chrome, Edge, or Opera  
2. Connect your robot hub with a single click  
3. Configure motor ports in the settings  
4. Record movements using the control panel  
5. Save your runs with custom names  
6. Replay them or export to Python
