**Visual programming for FLL teams**

CodLess is a web-based tool that helps FIRST LEGO League teams program their robots without writing complex code. You can connect your LEGO hub, record movements, save them as reusable runs, and use them during competitions.

**🔐 New: Secure Cloud Storage** - Sign in with email or Google to save your robot runs to the cloud, access them from any device, and collaborate with your team!

## Built-in Authentication System

CodLess includes a **complete authentication system that works instantly** - no setup, no configuration, no external services required!

### ✨ Zero Setup Required
Just open the website and it works! The authentication system is built directly into CodLess.

2. **Create an account** with email/password or use Google sign-in
3. **Your runs are automatically saved** to your account
4. **Sign in from any browser** on the same device to access your data
5. **Only you can access your runs** - each account is isolated

### Security Features:
