# CodLess – Intuitive Navigation for FLL Robots

**CodLess** is a no-code platform designed to make FLL robot navigation simple, accessible, and reliable for teams of all levels. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced team, CodLess helps you bring your robot to life — without writing a single line of code.

Built specifically for LEGO **SPIKE Prime**, CodLess allows you to plan and visualize missions with precision, then automatically generates the necessary code to execute them on the field using the Pybricks framework.

*It’s fast. It’s simple. It just works.*

## Why CodLess?

Too many great ideas get lost in technical complexity. CodLess was created to remove that barrier and let teams focus on what matters: strategy, creativity, and performance.

Our mission is to help teams around the world participate fully in FLL — no matter their coding experience.

## How It Works

1. Define your robot’s starting position  
2. Create a sequence of movements using the visual editor  
3. Add logic for turns, sensors, and mission triggers  
4. Export the code and run it on your SPIKE Prime robot  

No setup headaches. No code errors. Just results.
