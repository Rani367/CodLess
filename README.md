CodLess – Intuitive Navigation for FLL Robots
CodLess is a no-code platform designed to make FLL robot navigation simple, accessible, and reliable for teams of all levels. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced team, CodLess helps you bring your robot to life — without writing a single line of code.

Built specifically for LEGO SPIKE Prime, CodLess allows you to plan and visualize missions with precision, then automatically generates the necessary code to execute them on the field using the Pybricks framework.

It’s fast. It’s simple. It just works.

Features
Intuitive interface for creating robot paths and actions

Designed exclusively for SPIKE Prime

No programming knowledge required

Logic tools for movement, turns, and sensor-based decisions

Generates ready-to-run Pybricks code for your missions

Why CodLess?
Too many great ideas get lost in technical complexity. CodLess was created to remove that barrier and let teams focus on what matters: strategy, creativity, and performance.

Our mission is to help teams around the world participate fully in FLL — no matter their coding experience.

How It Works
Define your robot’s starting position

Create a sequence of movements using the visual editor

Add logic for turns, sensors, and mission triggers

Export the code and run it on your SPIKE Prime robot

No setup headaches. No code errors. Just results.

Open Source and Open to All
CodLess is an open-source project developed to make robotics education more accessible. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome.
