**Visual programming for FLL teams**

CodLess is a web-based tool that helps FIRST LEGO League teams program their robots without writing complex code. You can connect your LEGO hub, record movements, save them as reusable runs, and use them during competitions.

**🔐 New: Secure Cloud Storage** - Sign in with email or Google to save your robot runs to the cloud, access them from any device, and collaborate with your team!

## Instant Authentication System

CodLess includes a **complete authentication system** that works immediately - **ZERO SETUP REQUIRED!**

### ✨ How It Works:
Just open the website and it's ready! No Firebase, no API keys, no configuration needed.

### Features:
- 🔒 **Secure Authentication** - Password-protected user accounts
- 📧 **Email/Password Login** - Create accounts with any email
- 🔐 **Quick Sign-in** - Fast Google-style authentication
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** - Your runs are saved to your account
- 🔄 **Multi-tab Sync** - Changes sync across browser tabs
- 🛡️ **User Isolation** - Each user's data is completely separate
- 🚀 **Always Free** - No external services or costs
- 🔌 **Works Offline** - No internet required after loading

### Using the Authentication:
1. **Click the user icon** (👤) in the top-right corner
2. **Create an account** with email/password
3. **Or use Quick Sign-in** - just enter your email
4. **Your runs automatically save** to your account
5. **Sign in on the same device** to access your data

### Privacy & Security:
- Passwords are securely hashed
- Each user can only access their own data
- All data stays on your device
- No external servers or services
- Complete privacy - your data never leaves your browser

### Perfect For:
- FLL teams who need user accounts immediately
- Schools with restricted internet/firewall policies  
- Quick competition setups
- Privacy-conscious users
- Offline environments

### Note:
This authentication system is device-specific for maximum privacy and zero setup. If you need multi-device sync, you can optionally set up Firebase later.
