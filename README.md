**Visual programming for FLL teams**

CodLess is a web-based application that helps FIRST LEGO League teams control and program their robots without writing complex code. Teams can record robot movements, save them as reusable runs, and execute them during competitions.

## [Live Demo](https://rani367.github.io/CodLess/)

## Features

- Connect to Pybricks-compatible LEGO hubs via Bluetooth
- Record robot movements and save them as named runs
- Upload and execute Python code directly to the hub
- Real-time 3D visualization of robot movements
- Calibrate motors for precise control
- Export and import run configurations
- Works offline after initial load
- No installation required

## Quick Start

1. Open [CodLess](https://rani367.github.io/CodLess/) in a web browser that supports Web Bluetooth (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
2. Click "Connect Robot" to pair with your Pybricks hub
3. Configure your motor ports in the settings
4. Start recording movements using the control panel
5. Save your recordings as named runs for later use
