**Visual programming for FLL teams**

CodLess is a web-based tool that helps FIRST LEGO League teams program their robots without writing complex code. You can connect your LEGO hub, record movements, save them as reusable runs, and use them during competitions.

## [Live Demo](https://rani367.github.io/CodLess/)

---

## Features

- Connect to Pybricks-compatible LEGO hubs using Bluetooth
- Record robot movements and save them as named runs
- Upload and run Python code directly on the hub
- Real-time 2D simulation of robot movements
- Motor calibration for accurate control
- Export and import saved runs
- Works offline after the first load
- Runs in the browser, no installation needed

---

## Quick Start

1. Open [CodLess](https://rani367.github.io/CodLess/) in Chrome, Edge, or Opera
2. Click **Connect Robot** to pair with your Pybricks hub
3. Configure motor ports in the settings
4. Record movements using the control panel
5. Save runs with custom names for later use
6. Replay runs or export them as Python code
